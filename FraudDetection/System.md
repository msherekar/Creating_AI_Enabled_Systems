# **Motivation (WHY's)**

## **Why are we solving this problem?**

**Problem Statement**: Performance of model for fraud detection has deteriorated (Precision = 70% & Recall = 40%). Hence, we are solving this problem to improve model performance by improving both the metrics

 **Value Proposition**: A better model will prevent fraudulent transactions thereby improving company profits.

 **Why is our solution a viable one**?

 We are proposing a machine learning based solution. It is a viable solution because of its accurate prediction capability, fully automated nature and ability to course correct if anything happens. Also, we have access to tons of data which will enable construction of a robust model.

We can tolerate some degree of risk in the sense that blocking non-fradulent transactions at the expense of preventing loss of money for customers. This can be taken care of temporary blocking. This will help us prevent spending time and resources to get the money back for customers, track down fraudsters and litigate the case(s). On the same note, we should be able to tolerate mistakes because we will have other avenues to get the money back. These avenues include litigation and immediate refunds to the customer.

This solution is a feasible one because we have the data and compute power.

## **Risk & Uncertainties**

### **What are possible harms?**
Possible harms for a ML based fraud detection system include - faulty detections (change words), inconvenience to the customers if their legitimate transactions get blocked, super inconvenience if a time-dependent transaction is blocked. Then, secondly missing on fraud detection all together causing monetary losses to the company as well as customer and downstream hassle. Overall, this can add an overhead expenditure to recover and rectify transactions missed by the ML systems.

### **What are causes of mistakes?**
Mistakes can arise from stale data or incorrect data. Also, faulty pre-processing can lead to mistakes. Absence of variety in data will not able the model to generalize or learn hollistically. 

# **Implementation (HOW's)**

## **Development**

### **Methodology:** 
- **ETL Pipeline:** Develop an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline to preprocess and clean the data, including steps such as data normalization, feature engineering, and outlier detection to improve model performance. 

- **Feature Engineering**: Four new features ('time_period', 'Low_avg_transactions_per_day', 'average_transactions_per_day', 'is_night') were engineered based on exploratory data analysis. 
1. 'time_period' is categorical features with four labels summer, holidays, post-holidays and rest_of_year. It was designed this way because data showed most of the fraudulent transactions belonged to summer, holidays and post-holiday period
2. 'is_night' is a binary feature having 0 for transactions happening between 4am to 10pm and 1 for transactions between 10pm-4am. It was designed this way because most of the fraudulent transactions happened in the night between 10pm-4am
3. 'average_transactions_per_day' is also is a binary feature. It came into picture after data showed that there two groups of clients -  those who have average transactions per day between 1-6 tend to be victims and vice versa
4. 'average_transactions_per_day' is a numerical feature where i calculated average transactions for unique victims
5. Overall, my data transformation includes grouping transactions by unique victims and adding new features.

- **Dataset Partitioning:** Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate the model's performance. To ensure representative samples for each class, considering the imbalanced nature of fraud detection datasets, following steps were taken-
1. Stratified sampling 
2. 5-fold cross validation
3. Oversampling of minority class so as to have 1:1 ratio prior to splitting
4. While splitting, used group fold to ensure transactions of each customer stayed in one of test, validation or training set

- **Metrics and Advanced Metrics:** Define evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score to assess model performance. 
1. Recall: Prioritize recall because the cost of false negatives (failing to detect actual fraudulent transactions) is high. Missing fraudulent activities can lead to financial losses and legal consequences.
2. Precision: Precision can be compromised because the cost of false positives (misclassifying a non-fraudulent transaction as fraudulent) is not as high as failing to detect a fraudulent transaction. Blocking legitimate transactions as fraud might result in customer dissatisfaction but it might be as bad as compared to missing a actual fraudulent transaction.
3. F1 score: Use this metric to compare different modeling strategies.

- **Model Selection:** Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques to identify the optimal model configuration for maximizing fraud detection recall score.

1. Based on this decision to prioritize Recall over Precision, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines will be preferred models of choice. Also, ensemble models using Stacking Classifier (Linear Discriminant Analysis & Decision Tree) can also be used.
 
-** Deployment Strategy**

The deployment strategy for the fraud detection system involves packaging the machine learning model into a Dockerized system architecture. The system will utilize a class named Fraud_Detector_Model defined in the model.py module to construct and handle the model logic. The system will be capable of receiving input data via requests sent through Postman, which should be in the format of a row from the provided dataset. Additionally, an ETL pipeline will be utilized to transform the input data into usable features. The final system will be packaged into a Docker image and published on DockerHub for ease of deployment.
